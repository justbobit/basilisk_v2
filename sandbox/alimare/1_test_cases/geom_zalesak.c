/**
##Definition of the boolean operation

Between 2 volumes (or surface in 2D), we can define a union, an intersection and a substraction of the volume.

Let use A and B, 2 volumes of the space, such that $A = f(x,y,z)$ and $B = g(x,y,z)$. Then:

$$A \cap B = max (f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z))$$
$$A \cup B = min (f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z))$$
$$A - B = max(f(x,y,z), -g(x,y,z))$$

Pay attention, in Basilisk, the surface expressions have to be continuous
function.

For example, a sphere is define with the following function:

$$f(x,y,z) = (x - x_c)^2 + (y-y_c)^2 + (z-z_c)^2 - R^2$$

In the sphere, $f$ is negative, allong the interface, $f$ is equal to zero and
outside of the sphere, $f$ is positive. The function is continuous. 

In basilisk, once you gave $f$ to the macros "fraction", the code will generate
an interface when $f$ is equal to zero.

##Definition of the geometric interface

We define first 2 basic geometric functions, a shpere and a cube.

The cube is centered on "center", and has a lenght of "size".
