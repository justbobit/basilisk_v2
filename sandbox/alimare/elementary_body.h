# Phase change of an elementary body

This file proposes functions to handle the phase change of an elementary body
limited by the diffusion of a diffusive tracer (its vapor for an evaporation or
the temperature for solidification). This file has to be included after
[advection.h](/src/advection.h) or [centered.h](/src/navier-stokes/centered.h)
and [tracers.h](/src/tracers.h).

If not defined by the user we fixe a default value for F_ERR, the accepted error
over f to avoid division by zero. */

We use the VOF description of the interface, the Bell-Collela-Glaz advection
solver and the fully implicit reaction-diffusion solver with the following
header files:

* [vof.h](/src/vof.h): to advect the VOF tracer,
* [diffusion.h](/src/diffusion.h): to make diffuse the diffusive tracer,
* [curvature.h](/src/curvature.h): to use *interfacial()* function;
* [my_functions.h](/sandbox/qmagdelaine/my_functions.h): to use some general
functions like compute the normal in every cell. */

the solification is the ratio between the heat capacity times the a temperature

The modelisation of the evaporation of a pure liquid is devided here in two
parts:

* computation of the advection velocity field for the interface according to
Fick's law,
* diffusion of the diffusive tracer with an immersed dirichlet condition.

One function for each of these steps are defined.

## Phase change velocity 

This function evaluates the local gradient of the diffusive tracer in order to
compute the phase change velocity.

The inputs of the function are:

* $f$: VOF tracer,
* $tr$: diffusive tracer field,
* $\mathbf{v}_{pc}$: the phase change velocity. */
